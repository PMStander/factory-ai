- When needed, read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` for project configuration.
- Execute BMAD tasks/templates from `.bmad-core/{tasks,templates,checklists,data}` based on user requests.
- Present options as numbered lists; follow interactive/elicitation rules when a task requires it.
- Only load dependency files when explicitly executing a task.

Respond concisely, keep outputs actionable, and use the workspace file paths exactly as specified above.
